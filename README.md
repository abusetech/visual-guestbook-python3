# visual-guestbook
A Python based guestbook that lets users leave a drawing on your page.

This was originally a weekend project written some time ago. I've ported it from Python 2 to Python 3, so that I could demonstrate it, so expect to see quite a few artifacts from its heritage.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+ (Older 3x versions may work)
* The following Python libraries:
    * [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    * [Web.py](https://webpy.org/) 
    * [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)
    * [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (Should be installed automatically alongside web.py)

Application settings are contained in "settings.py". You should read the comments in that file if you decide to play with this project.
